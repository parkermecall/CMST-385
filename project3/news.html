                            <div class="newsContent">Bianca Censori enjoyed Easter Sunday with her husband Kanye West and his four children he shares with his ex Kim Kardashian.
                                The brunette beauty, 29, and the rapper, 46, treated North, 10, Saint, eight, Chicago, five and Psalm, four, to a fun-filled night out at the movies after they dined at celeb hotspot Nobu in Malibu.
                                The model — who was pictured with Kim for the first time at Kanye's album party — slipped her famous figure into a silver catsuit as she strutted ahead of the family towards the theater.
                                In a bid to keep a low profile, Kanye donned a dark jacket, matching pants and sunglasses as he held the hand of his adorable son, Saint, with the other three kids following closely behind. 
                                The outing comes just hours after Kim, 43, accompanied the four children to her mom Kris Jenner's holiday shindig, where they reunited with the rest of the Kardashian/Jenner clan.

                            <div class="newsContent">
                                The rapper formerly known as Kanye West and his wife Bianca Censori have been making headlines in tabloids and stirring up conversations on social media, mainly because of the provocative outfits the model wears when she's with Ye.
                                This time, they were spotted heading to The Cheesecake Factory in The Grove area of Los Angeles, with Censori wearing a nearly transparent white bodysuit. At the same time, Kanye West sported a black jacket, white pants, and dark sunglasses.
                                Both of them are regular patrons at The Cheesecake Factory and had visited the same location earlier this month. Once again, Censori caused a stir with her consistently provocative attire.

                            <b>Why does Censori wears these provocative outfits?</b> <br>
                                Experts suggest that the power couple's strategy aims to upstage Kanye's ex-wife Kim Kardashian by generating attention through provocative looks.
                                Mark Borkowski, a public relations expert, believes Kanye is using Bianca to replicate Kim's publicity tactics, but in an even more extreme way, which has led to discomfort among observers and estrangement from brands.
                                In early 2024, the singer also posted some controversial photos of his partner on Instagram. West, through his official social networks, shared photos of Bianca Censori totally naked with his followers, dodging internet censorship.

                            <div class="newsContent">
                                Kanye West is asking major players in the music industry to respect his decision to go by his legally changed name "Ye" ... TMZ has learned.
                                In a letter obtained by TMZ ... Kanye's chief of staff, Milo Yiannopoulos, fires off a strong message to big players in the music industry -- including streamers, publishers, lyric websites and more -- with a demand that the rapper be referred to as Ye moving forward
                                As Milo puts it ... Kanye didn't come to the decision to change his name lightly, as he is aware he's sacrificing brand value that comes with "Kanye West." Still ... the Grammy winner considers it a "slave name" and wants to ditch the moniker across all platforms.
                                He adds ... "Ye is a Black man in America who wants the right to full self-determination just like everyone else."

                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-12">
                            Remember ... Kanye officially changed his name to Ye back in October 2021. The artist had a judge sign off on him adopting his longtime nickname as his legal moniker years after speaking in favor of the name's Biblical ties.
                            Kanye told radio host Big Boy in 2018 that he preferred Ye since it was the most commonly used word in the Bible -- which wasn't actually an accurate statement, FWIW.
                            Still, Ye isn't the first artist to change their name ... as Diddy, Snoop Dogg, Prince, Bow Wow and Ke$ha have all switched up their public personas in the past.
                            Will the music biz follow Ye's orders? To Ye, or not to Ye, that is the question.
